title: 'Catalan Language'
---
 Catalan is a [Romance language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages) originating from [Catalonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Catalonia). Pa√Øsos Catalans, or countries that speak Catalan, are Andorra, Italy, France, and Spain. Andorra uses Catalan as the official language. [Valencian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencian_language) is considered to be another name for Catalan which is spoken in [Valencia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencian_Community). Valencian is within the western group of Catalan dialects. There are over 11 million native speakers.

 The Catalan dialects differ mostly in pronunciation. There is said to be no Catalan speaker who cannot understand Spanish. This can be incredibly useful, as Spanish is the second most commonly spoken language in the world. Keep in mind that everyone is different and there will be people who can't understand both languages. The Romance languages are mostly mutually intelligible. Catalan uses two genders, masculine and feminine. The [Catalan alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_alphabet) derives from the Latin alphabet and is based on the language's phonology. 
   
You can find many comparisons of words within the Western Romance languages [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language#Relationship_with_other_Western_Romance_languages).
If you are interested in learning Catalan, I recommend these websites:

* [Parla.cat](http://www.parla.cat/)
* [Livemocha](http://livemocha.com/pages/languages/learn-catalan/)
* [interc@t](http://www.intercat.cat/speakcat/)
* [FontdelCat](http://ice.uab.cat/fontdelcat/)
* [Catalan 101](http://www.101languages.net/catalan/)

I recommend Livemocha because you can speak with people who speak Catalan fluently and get help with pronunciation and learning the language. It is good to explore many different language learning websites.
Catalan 101 gives you links to a large variety of websites that use Catalan, including online newspapers and radio. I strongly suggest listening to the Catalan radio stations because being able to understand a language when it is spoken is just as important as knowing how to read it. As someone who has learned a language before, I found that it's easy to end up only learning the written language and then was surprised that I couldn't understand people when they spoke it to me, despite knowing all of the words that they said.

I found most of my information about the language on Wikipedia. I also looked through some online forums where people were talking about the language. If you see anything that is inaccurate, please don't hesitate to contact me to correct me.

If you or someone you know can write Catalan fluently, please let me know. I would be thrilled to have someone to help me translate this website into Catalan. I will do some learning of this language myself, but I don't trust that I will be able to translate everything perfectly.
