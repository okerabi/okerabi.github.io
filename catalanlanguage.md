Catalan is a [Romance language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages), originating from [Catalonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Catalonia), with over 11 million native speakers. Països Catalans, countries where the language is spoken, are Andorra, Italy, France, and Spain. Andorra uses Catalan as its official language. [Valencian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencian_language) is a variation of Catalan which is spoken in [Valencia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencian_Community). It is within the western group of Catalan dialects. The major difference between the various dialects is pronunciation. 

It is a common belief that all Catalan speakers can understand Spanish. This can be incredibly useful, as Spanish is the second most commonly spoken language in the world. Keep in mind that everyone is different and there will be people who can't understand both languages. Though, the Romance languages are largely mutually intelligible. The [Catalan alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_alphabet) is also derived from the Latin alphabet and is based on the language's phonology. 
   
You can find some direct comparisons of several common words within the Western Romance languages [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language#Relationship_with_other_Western_Romance_languages).

As far as grammar, Catalan uses the masculine and feminine genders.

If you are interested in learning Catalan, I recommend these websites:
* [Parla.cat](http://www.parla.cat/)
* [Livemocha](http://livemocha.com/pages/languages/learn-catalan/)
* [interc@t](http://www.intercat.cat/speakcat/)
* [FontdelCat](http://ice.uab.cat/fontdelcat/)
* [Catalan 101](http://www.101languages.net/catalan/)

It is good to explore many different language learning websites. 

I particularly recommend Livemocha because the best way to learn a language is to speak with a native speaker. On Livemocha you can speak with people who are fluent in Catalan and they can help with pronunciation while you’re learning the language. 

Catalan 101 links you to a large variety of websites that use Catalan, including online newspapers and radio. Immersing yourself in the language by listening to the Catalan radio stations is something I strongly suggest because it is just as important that you are able to understand a language when it is spoken as being able to read it. I found that it's easy to end up only learning the written language when picking up a new language. I was surprised that I couldn't understand people when they spoke to me, despite knowing all of the words that were said. 

I found most of my information about the language on Wikipedia and some online forums where people were talking about the language. If you see anything that is inaccurate, please don't hesitate to let me know so it can be corrected. 

If you or someone you know can write Catalan fluently, please let me know. I would be thrilled to have someone to help me translate this website into Catalan. I will do some studying of the language myself, but I don't trust that I will be able to translate everything perfectly.
